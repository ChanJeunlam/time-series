# time-series

This package contains all necessary files for the course *Ocean/Atmosphere Time Series Analysis*, an introduction to data and time series analysis for graduate students in oceanography, atmospheric science, and climate.  

This material is generally taught in two separate portions, a five-day and a ten-day intensive, both with five hours a day of course time.  The first intensive covers *Part I: Fundamentals*, while the second intensive covers *Part II: Spectral and Time-Frequency Analysis*.  See the course [home page](http://www.jmlilly.net/courses.html) for a list of upcoming and past courses.

Comments, questions, bug reports, etc. are all welcome.  Feel free to email me at [jmlilly@psi.edu](mailto:jmlilly@psi.edu), or use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/time-series/issues).

To get started, just open the file `index.html` with any web browser.  

There you will find lecture notes, viewable through a web browser, as well as lab files in the form of Jupyter notebooks.  The lab files have parallel translations in both Matlab and Python.  Each lab file has both an html version for convenient reading, as well as an ipynb version that can be run locally.  All necessary data files are included.  For those wishing to set up Jupyter notebooks to work with Matlab, instructions can be found [here](http://www.jmlilly.net/jupyter-matlab).

The lecture notes were made using [Liminal](http://www.jmlilly.net/liminal), a theme for [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/), itself a Javascript package for rendering Markdown and LaTeX as Powerpoint-style presentations within a web browser.  A complete distribution of [KaTeX](https://katex.org), a minimal typesetting library for LaTeX, is also included.

Version 0.2 is the initial public release of the *Ocean/Atmosphere Time Series Analysis* course files.  A significant to-do in this version is translating the stochastic modeling code into Python.
