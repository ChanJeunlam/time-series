# time-series

This package contains all necessary files for the course *Ocean/Atmosphere Time Series Analysis*, an introduction to data and time series analysis for graduate students in oceanography, atmospheric science, and climate.  

This material is generally taught in two separate portions, a five-day and a ten-day intensive, both with five hours a day of course time.  The first intensive covers *Part I: Fundamentals*, while the second intensive covers *Part II: Spectral and Time-Frequency Analysis*.  See the course [home page](http://www.jmlilly.net/courses.html) for a list of upcoming and past courses.

Comments, questions, bug reports, etc. are all welcome.  Feel free to email me at [jmlilly@psi.edu](mailto:jmlilly@psi.edu), or use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/time-series/issues).
